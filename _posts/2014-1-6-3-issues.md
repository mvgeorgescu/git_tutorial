### Issues: Streamlining Project Management

- Key Features:
  - Create: Start a new issue to document a problem, idea, or task.
  - Assign: Assign tasks to team members, set priorities, and track progress.
  - Discuss: Engage in threaded discussions to brainstorm solutions, provide feedback, and collaborate on resolutions.
  - Close: Mark issues as resolved once the task is completed or the problem is addressed.

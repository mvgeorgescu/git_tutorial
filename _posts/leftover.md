Collaborative Git workflows enable multiple developers to work together efficiently on a shared codebase. These workflows define how changes are proposed, reviewed, and integrated into the project.

### Collaborative Features - Pull Requests:

- Pull requests (PRs) facilitate code review and collaboration by allowing developers to propose changes to a project and request feedback from their peers.
- Developers create a pull request by selecting a branch with changes and specifying the target branch for the merge (e.g., merging a feature branch into main).
- Team members review the pull request, leave comments, and suggest improvements before the changes are merged into the target branch.

### Merging Pull Requests:

- Once a pull request has been reviewed and approved, it can be merged into the target branch.
- The merge operation integrates the changes from the source branch into the target branch, creating a new commit that represents the merge.
- It's essential to resolve any outstanding issues or concerns raised during the code review process before merging the pull request.

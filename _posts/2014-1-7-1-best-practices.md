### Commit Often and with Meaningful Messages:

- Break your work into smaller, logical units and commit changes frequently.
- Each commit should represent a single, atomic change with a clear purpose.
- Write descriptive commit messages that explain the what and why of the changes.
- Follow a consistent commit message format (e.g., imperative tense, concise summary).

### Use Branches for Isolated Work:

- Create branches for new features, bug fixes, or experiments to isolate changes from the main codebase.
- Branching allows multiple developers to work on different parts of the project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.
- Adopt a branching strategy that suits your project's needs, such as Gitflow or feature branches.

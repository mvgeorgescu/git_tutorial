### What is it?
- Version control systems (VCS) are tools that manage changes to files over time.
- They enable collaboration among multiple contributors by allowing them to work on the same project concurrently.

### Why is it important?
Every project begins with an idea, and regardless of the output, it is an iterative process. Change management is important in keeping this output safe, retaining a history of changes, and tracking authorship.

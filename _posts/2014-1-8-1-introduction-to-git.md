- Git is a distributed version control system developed by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux.
- Initially created for managing the complex development of the Linux kernel, Git has since evolved into a versatile tool used across various industries and projects.
- Designed with speed, efficiency, and distributed development in mind, Git allows developers to collaborate seamlessly on projects of any size.
- Its decentralized architecture enables each user to have a complete copy of the repository, promoting flexibility and scalability in development workflows.

### Importance of Version Control
- Facilitates collaboration: Allows team members to work on the same project concurrently.
- History tracking: Records who made changes and when, enabling accountability.
- Revert changes: Easily roll back to previous versions if needed.

### Types of Version Control Systems

- **Centralized VCS**: Uses a central server to store files and version history. (e.g., SVN)
- **Distributed VCS**: Each user has a complete copy of the repository. (e.g., Git, Mercurial)

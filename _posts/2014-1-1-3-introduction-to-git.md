- Git is a distributed version control system developed by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux.
- Initially created for managing the complex development of the Linux kernel, Git has since evolved into a versatile tool used across various industries and projects.
- Designed with speed, efficiency, and distributed development in mind, Git allows developers to collaborate seamlessly on projects of any size.
- Its decentralized architecture enables each user to have a complete copy of the repository, promoting flexibility and scalability in development workflows.
- Widely adopted as the industry standard for version control, Git has become the cornerstone of modern software development practices.

# Introduction to Version Control Systems (VCS)

---

## What is Version Control?

- Version control systems (VCS) track changes to files over time.
- They enable collaboration among multiple contributors.
- Examples include Git, SVN, and Mercurial.

## Importance of Version Control

- Facilitates collaboration: Allows team members to work on the same project concurrently.
- History tracking: Records who made changes and when, enabling accountability.
- Revert changes: Easily roll back to previous versions if needed.

## Types of Version Control Systems

- **Centralized VCS**: Uses a central server to store files and version history. (e.g., SVN)
- **Distributed VCS**: Each user has a complete copy of the repository. (e.g., Git, Mercurial)
